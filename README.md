# My Experience
Working as a programmer, software tester, and manual tester on my last project, AcademicHub has been a valuable experience in both technical and analytical aspects. I have gained hands-on experience in identifying and reporting software issues, ensuring the application's functionality and reliability. Additionally, I was responsible for creating and maintaining documentation, which helped streamline development and testing processes. This role has strengthened my problem-solving skills and attention to detail, further solidifying my interest in quality assurance. My experience in both programming and testing has given me a well-rounded perspective, allowing me to contribute effectively to software development and QA processes.
